      <description>Introduction In the Discourse, Rousseau presents his view of man in nature as a strong, agile being whose needs are few and easily met. He rejects the moral sense attributed to man by Hobbes and describes the natural man as self-sufficient, peaceful, and devoid of vanity and selfishness. Rousseau then traces the evolution of language and explores the roots of inequality, attributing it primarily to the institution of property.
There are few philosophical works as powerful or as lasting as Jean-Jacques Rousseau&amp;rsquo;s Discourse on Inequality.</description>
